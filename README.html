<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Thank you for installing the DJ Request application. This is a very early build of the application and should <strong>not</strong> be used in commercial production enrivonments.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress application that is in it's infancy. This is a proof of concept of a DJ music request application that is both web based and cross platform.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>NOTE: This application is in it's very early stages of development and should not be used in a production environment and is provided 'As Is' for educational purposes.</strong></p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>This application comes installed on the specific hardware by our own engineers.</p>
<h3>The Server</h3>

<p>The server application runs in python with both a console and GUI. This accepts song requests from the client applications. The DJ can then mark off the requests as they arrive at the system.</p>
<h3>The Client</h3>

<p>The client application runs in python with both a console and a GUI. This application sends song requests to a server on running on the same network. The user can choose from a genre, individual song or manually type a request before it is sent.</p>
